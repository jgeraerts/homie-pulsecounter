# homie-pulsecounter

small sketch for esp8266 to count pulses. Is being used to count pulses from a reed switch connected to my gas meter which allows me to monitor my gas usage. 

Makes use of [homie-esp8266](https://github.com/homieiot/homie-esp8266) for wifi and mqtt setup.

To build platformio.org is being used.
